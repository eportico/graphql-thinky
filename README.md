Graphql-thinky helps you to construct your GraphQL schema and the communication layer to a RethinkDB backend. It will perform **batched** and **optimised** queries, during graphql requests. the library is powered by the fantastic thinky ORM and Graphql / RelayJS which rely on.

Inspired by the great [graphql-sequelize](https://github.com/mickhansen/graphql-sequelize). If you have a SQLs application i suggest to look at it.  

###Documentation
You can find it here: [https://graphql-thinky.readme.io](https://graphql-thinky.readme.io)

### Milestone

This library has been just backed with :heartpulse:  and with in it's early version can already provide pleasure to build your own GraphQL schema; although it needs the **community support** to grow and evolve to achieve the **v1.0**.

Here is the features not yet implemented, that i'm willing to add over the time.

- **Subscription** helpers for graphql, so that we can fully use RethinkDB amazing **change feed**
- **Mutation** helpers, to allow create simple mutation in few lines
- Custom query overwrites - to allow the developer to extend the default query behaviour of **graphql-thinky** on every Node.
- Increase test case coverage
- and much more when new feature are requested from the folks...

### Contribution

To contribute to the repo, you can do it in few ways:

- **Bugs**: Open a issue into github, add the test case to reproduce the bug (if possible)
- **New features**: Open an issue into github, explain the needs of the feature once the feature is agreed i will happy to receive Pull request with related tests cases, if you can't do that I'll try to help for the implementation.

**Note**: As the repository grow we will add more strict guidelines for contribution
